ICE 04 - COMPONENTS
Mood Tracker from Assignment 3 Updated with React

Student: Amanda Chavarria Pleitez

Group Number: N/A â€“ Completed independently

Notes:
I was unable to attend class in person due to feeling unwell, so I completed this project independently from home once I felt better. I reached out to classmates about joining a group for the components assignment, but all groups were full, so I worked on it solo.

Project Overview:
This project is a Mood Tracker web app where users can log their daily mood, energy level, and notes. In this update, the main mood tracker functionality from Assignment 3 was refactored into a React component (MoodTracker.jsx) while keeping the login UI as a static page (login.html). The React app dynamically fetches, displays, edits, and deletes user entries, and the original styling was preserved using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

Reflection:
Working with React made the mood tracker more modular and easier to maintain, especially for managing state and updating entries. Setting up the Vite build process and ensuring the static login page worked alongside the React app added some initial complexity, but overall it improved the development workflow.

Instructions:
- Open the app using the hosting link above.
- Log in or create a new account using your username and password.
- Add, edit, or delete mood tracker entries on the dashboard.
- All entries are saved and fetched dynamically via the backend server(Express + MongoDB).
