ICE 04 - COMPONENTS 
Mood Tracker From Assignment 3 Updated w/ React



This project is a Mood Tracker web app where users can log their daily mood, energy level, and notes. In this update, I refactored the main mood tracker functionality from Assignment 3 into a React component (MoodTracker.jsx), while keeping the login UI as a static page (login.html). The React app now dynamically fetches, displays, edits, and deletes user entries, and the original styling was preserved using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

Reflection:
Working with React made the mood tracker more modular and easier to maintain, especially when handling state and updating entries. At the same time, setting up the Vite build process and making sure the static login page worked alongside the React app added a bit of extra complexity, but overall it improved the development workflow.

Notes:
I was unable to attend class in person due to feeling unwell, so I worked on this project independently from home once I felt a bit better. I reached out to classmates about joining a group for the components assignment, but all groups were full, so I completed it on my own.
